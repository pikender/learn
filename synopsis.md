Raw thoughts

When you take chances on doubt (i.e. user.save won't fail here :P ), you can't be certain of outcome and
integrity.

Even minor doubt should be scrutized and addressed so that doubt can be
minimized and more certtainity can be brought.

Moral of the story
------------------

Don't overlook even the minor / one-in-a-million cases as it can cost
you millions.

As Rai mentioned, never ignore weak signals (always indicative of
something BIG).
